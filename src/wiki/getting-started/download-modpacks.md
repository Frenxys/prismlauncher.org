# Downloading Modpacks

Similar to [creating an instance](../create-instance), downloading a modpack can be done through the **Add Instance** menu. Or alternatively, *right click > create instance*
You can now use the sidebar to the left of the window to choose from the following:

* Import
* ATLauncher
* CurseForge
* FTB Legacy
* FTB App Import
* Modrinth
* Technic

After selecting which service you wish to use, you can browse the modpacks which available to install.

The "**Import**" option assumes that you have manually downloaded a modpack to your computer through other means, and will ask for a **.zip** or **.mrpack** archive containing a Prism Launcher compatible pack.

The **FTB App Import** option assumes that you have **FTB App** installed on your PC, and have the modpack installed in FTB App.
